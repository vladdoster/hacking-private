_Dbg_open_if_tty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 #
 # Return 0 if $1 is a tty and open it. Otherwise return
 # 0. _Dbg_new_fdi will be set to the file descriptor of the open tty
 # or set to -1 if none could be opened.  
 #
 # We write the interface this way because intead of say a routine to
 # test a name refers to a terminal, because it's easy to tell if a
 # file descriptor is a tty but not so easy using just the name. And we
 # want to avoid opening and closing file descriptors unnecessarily.
