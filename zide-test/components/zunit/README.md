ZUnit is a powerful unit testing framework for ZSH

## Installation

> **WARNING**: Although the majority of ZUnit's functionality works as expected, it is in the early stages of
> development, and as such bugs are likely to be present. Please continue with caution, and
> [report any issues](https://github.com/zunit-zsh/zunit/issues/new) you may have.

### [Zulu](https://github.com/zulu-zsh/zulu)

```sh
zulu install zunit
```

> **NOTE:** In versions of Zulu prior to `1.2.0`, there is an additional step required after install:

```sh
cd ~/.zulu/packages/zunit
./build.zsh
zulu link zunit
```

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install zunit-zsh/zunit/zunit
```

### Manual

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zunit-zsh/zunit
cd ./zunit
./build.zsh
chmod u+x ./zunit
cp ./zunit /usr/local/bin
```

> ZUnit requires [Revolver](https://github.com/molovo/revolver) to be installed, and in your `$PATH`. The zulu or
> homebrew installation methods will install this dependency for you.

## Writing Tests

### Test syntax

Tests in ZUnit have a simple syntax, which is inspired by the [BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) framework.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env zunit

@test 'My first test' {
	# Test contents here
}
```

The body of each test can contain any valid ZSH code. The zunit shebang `#!/usr/bin/env zunit` **MUST** appear at the
top of each test file, or ZUnit will not run it.
