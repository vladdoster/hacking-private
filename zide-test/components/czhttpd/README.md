# czhttpd

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsks/czhttpd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsks/czhttpd)

Simple http server written in 99.9% pure zsh

```
$ ./czhttpd -h
Usage: czhttpd [OPTIONS] [file or dir]

czhttpd - cloud's zsh http server

Options
    -c :    Optional configuration file (default: ~/.config/czhttpd/main.conf)
    -h :    Print this help message
    -p :    Port to bind to (default: 8080)
    -v :    Redirect log messages to stdout

If no file or directory is given, czhttpd defaults to serving
the current directory.
```

The czhttpd script is completely standalone. The only dependency is zsh version **5.6 or higher**. There is a
[docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jsks/czhttpd) available if the version shipped by your OS is older.

```sh
# Launch default directory listing of czhttpd files
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -it jsks/czhttpd

# To serve a local directory use a bind mount
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD:/data -it jsks/czhttpd czhttpd -v /data
```

### Optional Dependencies

When available:

- `file` is used for fallback mime-type support
- `ifconfig` is used on macOS/\*BSD when `IP_REDIRECT` is not set

### Features

- Basic support for `HTTP/1.1` (methods limited to `HEAD`, `GET`, `POST`)
- Dynamic directory listing with primitive caching
- UTF-8 support
- Multiple concurrent connections
- Live config reload
- Module support for:
  - Gzip compression
  - Basic CGI/1.1 support
    - phpMyAdmin appears fully functional, and partially Wordpress (requires configuring for an alternative port)
  - Basic url rewrite

### Configuration

The provided sample `conf/main.conf` lists the variables that can be changed. Any additional files or modules can be
sourced using the standard shell command, `source`. Similarly, the configuration variables for each module can be found
in their respective config files.

By default, czhttpd searches for `main.conf` in `~/.config/czhttpd/conf/`. An alternative configuration file can be
specified with the commandline option `-c`. If no file is found, then czhttpd will simply use the defaults listed in the
sample `conf/main.conf`.

#### Live Reload

czhttpd will automatically reload its configuration file and gracefully handle any changes and open connections when the
`HUP` signal is sent to the parent czhttpd pid. Ex:

```sh
$ kill -HUP <czhttpd pid>
```

### Testing

Integration and benchmarking stress tests are available and can be invoked either directly or through the provided
Makefile. Running the full test suite requires `md5sum`/`md5` and [vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta).

```sh
# Integration tests. Log file saved as `./test.log`
$ make test

# Stress tests with vegeta. Log file saved as `./stress.log`
$ make stress
```

The results from the latter tests are saved in `test/stress/report` and can be used by `vegeta report`. Additionally,
html plots will be automatically created and saved in `test/stress/html`.

Invoke the scripts directly for a full list of additional options.

```sh
$ test/integration/test.sh --help
$ test/stress/stress.sh --help
```

______________________________________________________________________

**Disclaimer**: This is *not* intended for serious use.

czhttpd is not portable between shells (POSIX, what?) and, of course, has terrible performance and scalability since it
spawns a separate child process to handle each incoming connection. It's also a shell script. On top of that, I
shouldn't even have to mention the (lack of) security...
